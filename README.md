# Python Notebook Collection

This repository hosts a series of Jupyter notebooks created while
exploring different data science topics. The notebooks originate from
online courses such as CognitiveClass.ai, Codecademy and Kaggle
exercises. A set of small utility functions is provided in
`utils/data_viz_utils.py` for loading data and producing plots.

## Contents

- **Data Visualization Notebooks** – five notebooks demonstrating pandas and
  matplotlib (`Cognitive_class_Data_Visualization_with_Python*.ipynb`).
- **Machine Learning Notebooks** – four notebooks covering introductory ML
  tasks (`Cognitive_class_ML*.ipynb`).
- **Miscellaneous** – practice notebooks from Codecademy, Kaggle exercises and
  an RBI analysis.

See [`docs/NOTEBOOK_SUMMARY.md`](docs/NOTEBOOK_SUMMARY.md) for a detailed
listing.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Open any notebook using JupyterLab or upload it to Google Colab.
3. Optionally import `utils/data_viz_utils.py` in a notebook to reuse the
   convenience functions.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements. Suggestions for
additional utility modules or better visualisations are welcome.
